# Perftest Tool

This command line tool can be used to test the performance of your configuration. There are quite
a few infrastructure and configuration options for setting up a cluster, as well as choosing which
topics to host on which clusters.

It's a really good idea to test the throughput of your configuration and tune settings to achieve
your required performance before putting production load on the cluster.

Note that this tool is not intended for generating load to test the throughput capacity of your
application. There are many load testing tools that provide the necessary features for evaluating
and correcting performance issues with your application, and this is not one of them.
